## How to create a viewport

A viewport is a bounding box created by two points, the bottom left point and the top right point. The simplest way to do
this is use [google maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@51.5259498,-0.0853759,18z). If you right click and navigate to "What here?" 
it will show you the cooridinates of the location (ie 51.5259498,-0.0853759)
